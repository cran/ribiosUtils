\title{Decode password with function implemented with pwencode}
\usage{
pwdecode(password)
}
\arguments{
\item{password}{Character string to be decoded. If starting with a empty
character, the string is sent for decoding; otherwise, it is deemed as clear
text password and returned.}
}
\value{
Decoded character string, or empty string if decoding fails
}
\description{
Decode password encypted with pwencode.
}
\details{
See pwdecode function documentation in BIOS for implemetnation details.

Note that since R does not support strings embedding null values
(\code{\000}), the password to be decoded has to be given with two slashes,
e.g. \sQuote{ \\001\\000\\129\\235}.
}
\examples{

mycode <- " \\\\001\\\\000\\\\141\\\\314\\\\033\\\\033\\\\033\\\\033\\\\033\\\\142\\\\303\\\\056\\\\166\\\\311\\\\037\\\\042"
