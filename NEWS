Version 1.0-43 (2014-08-15)
  + registerLog adds an extra option, append=FALSE, to provide alternative behavior to the logging machinary. Note that the default behaviour has changed from this version: previously files are only appended and never overwritten; from now on an existing file will be overwritten unless the append option is manually set to TRUE.
  + (Internal) add appendLogger function, which checks redundancy of loggers by the connection description string, in order to avoid appending loggers that have been in the list again.

Version 1.0-32 (2013-07-24)
  + Add qsystem to run system commands quietly
  + Add rmat to remove file/directories at a future time point
  + Add closeFileDevice() which quietly closes current device
  + openFileDevice() now sets useDingbat=FALSE by default for PDF outputs in order to achieve better compatibility with SVG files, and sets dpi as a parameter.

Version 1.0-31 (2013-07-19)
  + qqmsg only quits R when the session is not interactive.

Version 1.0-30 (2013-07-17)
  + openFileDevice use cairo as the PNG engine, since X11 engine does not seem to work in a non-interactive session

Version 1.0-29 (2013-06-27)

Version 1.0-28 (2013-05-16)

  + A substantial update of helping pages. Now almost every function exported by the ribiosUtils package has manuals and examples.
  + Add longdf2matrix to convert long-format data frame into matrix.
  + add compTwoVecs to compare two vectors using set operations

Version 1.0-25 (2012-12-04)
  + Add new function: trim, to trim (strip) leading and/or tailing spaces

Version 1.0-24 (2012-11-19)
  + Add new function: keepMaxStatRow, as a S4-object-independent implementation of the 'keepMaxStatProbe' function in ribiosExpression.It is faster and more generic.
  + extname adds an option to allow values other than NA returned if not found.

Version 1.0-23 (2012-11-02)
  + Internal changes: functions dealing with checking existence of files/directories are centralized in file_dir.R 

Version 1.0-22 (2012-10-24)
  + haltifnot: a typo was fixed in the msg
  + assertFile: error message is now more informative, printing files that do not exist.

Version 1.0-21 (2012-10-22)
  + Debugging set.R: mset.R does not fail with a vector as input: the vector is simply returned.

Version 1.0-20 (2012-10-17)
  + Add haltifnot, a function adapted from 'stopifnot', to print informative error messages

Version 1.0-19 (2012-10-03)
  + Add matchv, imatch, imatchv, ipmatch, ipmatchv for case-insentative matches

Version 1.0-18 (2012-10-02)

  + Add midentical to test whether all objects are identical

Version 1.0-16 (2012-06-22)
  + Add mmatch function: It performs efficient multiple matching between vectors using BIOS-C codes. Thanks to Roland Schmucki for sharing C codes.
  + Documentation and test files were added for mmatch
  + matchColumnIndex (and consequently matchColumn) uses mmatch for multiple matching, improving speed drastically
  + Add assertFile, assertDir, isDir, checkDir, checkFile, ... functions for scripting
  + Add various 'small' functions from on-going projects
  + Implement half of missing documentations

Version 1.0-15 (2012-06-20)
  + matchColumnIndex is not a little more efficient in doing the multiple matching. However it requires substantion re-coding in C to make it as efficient as normal match. The work is ongoing.

Version 1.0-14 (2012-06-06)
  + Add functions for scripting uses: setDebug, unsetDebug, isDebugging and isIntDebugging

  + Both matchColumnIndex and matchColumn supports the multi parameter, specifying the behaviour of function in multiple-matching cases.
  + matchColumnIndex over-writes the column with the master vector: also in the case of multiple mapping.
  + Documentations have been added for matchColumn and matchColumnIndex.

Version 1.0-9 (2012-02-06)
  + Add verbose function to allow verbose-level specific printing of verbose information, especially useful in programs with user interfaces.
